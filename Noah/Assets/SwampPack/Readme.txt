Winterleaf Entertainment Swamp Pack by Esteban Campos

Version 1.3

	- Added PBS materials (you'll find them in folders called "Unity 5").
	- Added Ambient Occlusion maps to mushrooms, trees and terrain materials.
	- Make sure to update your prefabs if you are going to use Unity 5's shaders (legacy shaders and prefabs are still in the package).
	- Also make sure to backup your project before importing/updating.



Version 1.2

 
	- Added "Web Demo" Scene to the package
 	
	- Slightly modified some materials (Birch trees).
 
	Make sure to backup your project before updating.



Version 1.1

  	
	- Added new tree prefabs that can be used with the terrain editor. 
	You can find then in a new folder called "Terrain Trees". A quick search tag could be "Terrain" when searching on the terrain editor.
	
These prefabs come with mesh colliders so you can use them directly as game objects (they have sof occlusion shaders). 
	Mesh colliders won't work on terrain and the 
only way to make them collide as terrain trees is adding capsule colliders. Though collision won't be as accurate as with mesh colliders.
  
	- Made some slighter modifications to some materials so be sure to back up your project before importing, otherwise it could replace your already modified materials and prefabs.
	


Version 1.0




	
	The Swamp Vegetation Pack contains 53 unique low poly models to create an outstanding swamp environment. 

Models come as ready to use prefabs. This art pack contains different bushes, plants, grass and ground textures each with their
 normal and specular maps.
 

	Important Information:

	
	- Plants with "bill" at the end of their name can be used as trees in the Terrain Editor (they billboard at a certain distance).

	
	- Prefab trees are meant to be used as prefabs only, and most of them come in two different LOD. 128 and 256. Trees won't work on terrains directly.
   
	For that reason there are two examples created with Unity's Tree Creator tool that can be used within the Terrain Editor. Textures
   and materials have been provided for this.
   
   
	- LOD could not be iplemented in this pack, as it was created with Unity's free version. If you happen to have Unity Pro, feel free to
   implement it by using the models provided.

   
	- Some materials included in the pack have "Cubemap Reflection". The cubemap in that folder uses textures from unity's skybox assets.
    Import that assets in order to make the reflection work, or use a cubemap of your own.
    
    
	- Particle Effects, Skyboxes and reflection cubemaps seen on the artwork are part of Unity's original assets and are not included in the pack.
