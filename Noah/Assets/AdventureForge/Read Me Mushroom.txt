PBR Mushroom Pack

PBR Mushroom Pack contains 15 different types of optimized mushrooms. 
The textures are PBR and ready for use with Unity’s standard shader. You also get prefabs with ready LOD system setup.

All textures are placed in an atlas and includes Albedo, Specular/Smoothness, Normal and Emission, 
with texture atlas from 1k, 2k and 4k. The empty spaces in the texture atlas is for coming updates in this package.

99 unique mushroom formations each with 3 levels of details, in total 297 models.
99 unique prefabs each with 3 different texture sizes, in total 297 prefabs.

Average triangles: LOD0 400, LOD1 288, LOD2 156.
Average verts: LOD0 334, LOD1 235, LOD2 150.
Texture atlas size: 1024 px, 2048 px, 4096 px.

Nice to know:
Every FBX got one single Smoothing Group for optimization. “Generate Lightmap” is enabled in every FBX, 
and “Import Materials” is disabled. Enabling “Import Materials” will give you an extra material folder 
below each mushroom type folder and might cause disorder in your project folder. No FBX has 
“Generate Colliders” enabled. Every prefab is set to Static.
